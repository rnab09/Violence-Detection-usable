About
This is my bachelor's thesis project which is based on Deep Learning. It can detect violence from the real-time footage such as webcam or if integrated in any edge devices. The model has been optimized to support low memory or lightweight devices to handle critical analysis and frameworks to detect violence with a accuracy of 80-90%
